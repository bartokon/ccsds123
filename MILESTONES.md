# Milestones

## Upcoming
- [ ] Restore Vivado project generation by running implementation parameter synthesis outside the Vivado TCL environment to avoid restricted Python executables.
- [ ] Align CPP, HDL, and AIE implementations for deterministic regression testing with shared stimuli.
- [ ] Add near-lossless compression modes and hybrid coder pathways with ISSUE-1 compatibility switches.
- [ ] Prototype vectorised AIE data paths for accelerated processing.
- [ ] Expand automated documentation derived from `docs/` research notes.

## Future Improvements
- Establish unified test vectors and golden references to keep CPP and HDL outputs in sync.
- Harden build scripts against environment-specific tooling limitations (e.g., bundled Python runtime permissions).
- Capture lessons learned and architecture decisions in an extended developer guide.
